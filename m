To pass messages between two virtual machines in VMware using Python, you can utilize sockets for communication. Here's a basic example:

python
# VM1 (Sender)
import socket

# Set up sender socket
sender_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sender_socket.bind(('0.0.0.0', 9999))  # Sender's IP and port
sender_socket.listen(1)

# Accept incoming connection from receiver
receiver_socket, receiver_address = sender_socket.accept()

# Send message
message = "Hello from VM1!"
receiver_socket.send(message.encode())

# Close sockets
sender_socket.close()
receiver_socket.close()


# VM2 (Receiver)
import socket

# Set up receiver socket
receiver_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
receiver_socket.connect(('VM1_IP', 9999))  # VM1's IP and port

# Receive message
message = receiver_socket.recv(1024)
print("Received message:", message.decode())

# Close socket
receiver_socket.close()


Replace 'VM1_IP' with the IP address of the sender VM. This code sets up a basic TCP connection between two virtual machines, with one acting as the sender and the other as the receiver. Make sure the firewall settings allow communication on the specified ports.
